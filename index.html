                            I finally got around to reading <i>Scythe</i> by Neal Shusterman a while ago. It was a pretty easy read with some thoughtful and interesting characters like Scythe Faraday and Scythe Curie. However, the "main characters"â€”since the book shifts between multiple random POVsâ€”felt very one-dimensional and hard to connect with. With that being said, the world-building was excellent, and the book raises some fascinating questions about life, death, and what it truly means to live. My biggest gripe? The forced romance between the main charactersâ€”it was completely unnecessary.

                            After <i>Scythe</i>, I picked up the second book in the series, <i>Thunderhead</i>. In contrast to the first book, this one dives much deeper into the Thunderheadâ€™s perspective, which I absolutely loved. Without a doubt, the best character in this book was the Thunderhead itself.  

                            As for the main characters, they spend most of the book apartâ€”Rowan is off on a vigilante mission, while Citra has fully stepped into her role as a Scythe. Weâ€™re also introduced to a new character, Greyson Tolliver. At first, I wasnâ€™t sure what his purpose was, but he quickly became a breath of fresh air. His dynamic with the Thunderhead was one of the most compelling parts of the book.  

                            Overall, I really enjoyed <i>Thunderhead</i>. Another quick and engaging read. <strong>4/5 stars</strong>.

                            The final book in the trilogy wasâ€¦ interesting, to say the least. For one, our main characters are barely present. Instead, we get a religious cult, a whole lot of other shenanigans, and a weirdly unexpected ending.  

                            (regarding the ending) 
                            It really made me wonderâ€”is this what Neal Shusterman believes the world is headed toward? Or does he see this as the <strong>only</strong> solution? Not that I necessarily disagree or have a better alternative, but itâ€™s definitely something to think about. The book raises some deep questions about human conflict and what the <strong>right</strong> solution to it might be. 
                            
                            Overall, it was a solid readâ€”quick and thought-provokingâ€”but it didnâ€™t quite live up to the first two books. <strong>3/5 stars</strong></p>

                                It's about the budding love between two young people in communist China. Without getting too controversial, it really captures the harsh realities of life back thenâ€”scarcity of food, a lack of political freedom, and the heavy burdens placed on individuals.

                                Sent off to do hard labor in the countryside, she meets a boy, and they fall in love. The movie then follows their journey as they face the many challenges of being a young couple in that tough era. <br><br> 
    
                                The film is genuinely beautiful to watch, and the lead actors really bring their characters to life. I've seen Zhou Dongyu in <i>Better Days</i> (T_T) and Shawn Dou in <i>Princess Agents</i> before, and while I already admired them, this movie made me see them in an entirely new light. Their acting is just phenomenal. This was my first real film from Mainland China, and I can tell thereâ€™s so much more for me to explore.<br>

                                It follows a woman in her 30s who feels stuck in life. She was once a free-spirited artist with a vibrant outlook, but now sheâ€™s living the life of a wealthy housewife, lacking the confidence to create art.<br><br>    

                                One day, she stumbles upon a commercial for a chocolate that claims to take you back to your younger days. She eats itâ€”and suddenly, her soul transforms into her 17-year-old self. Physically, she remains in the present, but mentally, sheâ€™s a teenager... <br><br>

                                This was such a fun movie! Ni Ni is such a dynamic actress. <br> <br>  

                                It follows a woman in her 30s who feels stuck in life. She was once a free-spirited artist with a vibrant outlook, but now sheâ€™s living the life of a wealthy housewife, lacking the confidence to create art.<br><br>    

                                One day, she stumbles upon a commercial for a chocolate that claims to take you back to your younger days. She eats itâ€”and suddenly, her soul transforms into her 17-year-old self. Physically, she remains in the present, but mentally, sheâ€™s a teenager again. <br><br>    

                                Each time she eats the chocolate, her 17-year-old self resurfaces, but the supply is limited. This leads to the chaotic coexistence of both versions of herself.<br><br>     

                                Her teenage self meets a rebellious biker boy and gets caught up in a whirlwind romance, bringing all sorts of trouble into the MCâ€™s life. Sheâ€™s impulsive, fearless, and stirs up chaosâ€”but she still has all her artistic talent and refuses to be spineless. Meanwhile, the MC is still holding onto feelings for her husband, who barely acknowledges her existence. <br><br>    

                                As time passes, the two versions of herself grow frustrated with one another. They have no choice but to learn how to coexist. (T_T) <br><br>    

                                The ending is surprisingly satisfyingâ€”the MC regains her sense of self and prevents her younger self from making the same reckless mistake she once did.<br><br>     

                                Overall, a super fun movie to watch. Also, Darren Wang??!!??.<br>
